Smart Windows is a proof of concept IoT system that detects environmental information about windows and allows you to control them.

The project was developed Brandon Ye, Evan Kilburn, Callum Kippin, Marc Kevin Quijalvo, Jimmy Lu, and Steven Wen at the 2020 L-Spark Secure IoT Hackathon, and was awarded the Solace Prize for Best Overall Implementation of Secure IoT Dev Kit. Smart Windows features a web application, web server, and API to connect to IoT hardware that can gather data from real world surroundings.
