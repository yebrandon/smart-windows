This project was developed Brandon Ye, Evan Kilburn, Callum Kippin, Marc Kevin Quijalvo, Jimmy Lu, and Steven Wen at the 2020 L-Spark Secure IoT Hackathon, and was awarded the Solace Prize for Best Overall Implementation of Secure IoT Dev Kit. It features a web application, web server, and API to connect to IoT hardware that can gather data from real world surroundings.
